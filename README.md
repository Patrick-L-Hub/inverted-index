# Inv-Index
 This is my learn python Capstone Project for the Udemy Complete Python bootcamp course by Jose Portilla  
 
 invIndex.py creates an inverted index storing the file name, line number, and word number on each line of occurance for all of the text files in the 'Text_files/' folder. 
 
 The user is prompted to supply a word and the invIndex.py script returns file name, line number, and word number for all instances of the word  
 
 invIndexFunctions.py contains the functions used to create the index, parse the index, and print locations of user specified words.
